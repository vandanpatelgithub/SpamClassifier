Subject: Graduate Project Proposal for Review

Hello Dr. Kung,

I hope you are doing well.

I am in your 589 (Tu-Th 5:30 - 6:45) section.

I would like to thank you for agreeing to be my reviewer.

I am sending you my project proposal in the attachment, so you have time to review it.

I am planning to get your signature on the proposal on Tuesday in class if that's possible.

Thanks for your time and efforts.

Regards,

Vandan Patel | Graduate Student | Computer Science
California State University, Fullerton
