Subject: Final Graduate Project Proposal

Dear Dr. Gofman,

Thanks once again for coming on-campus yesterday.

I have edited my proposal, and I am sending you the same in the attachment for review.

Please let me know if you want me to make any changes.

Thanks for your time and efforts.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Vandan Patel | Graduate Student | Computer Science
